"""
Study mode: opt-in, continuous screen capture for studying — the one place
in this feature (and in JARVIS generally) where vision runs on a timer
instead of once per explicit request.

Every other vision path in this codebase (screen_process, study_notes,
computer_control's screen_find) is one-shot and user-triggered. A background
watcher that keeps looking at the screen without being asked has a
meaningfully different privacy posture, so this is never turned on by
JARVIS on its own initiative — only ever by an explicit user request to
start it — costs an API call every interval, and is scoped to the current
process only (no persisted setting to survive a restart, unlike the
wake-word toggle): the user has to ask for it again next time on purpose.

Runs as a daemon thread guarded by module-level state rather than through
main.py's live session loop, so this feature doesn't need to touch that
already-large, already-in-flux file to work.
