"""
Study quiz: turn the last study notes (or a fresh screen capture) into a set
of quiz questions with answers, for the live model to ask one at a time.

Deliberately does NOT run the quiz itself — grading a spoken, free-form
answer ("um, I think it's mitochondria") against a stored string is an NLU
problem the live conversational model already handles well, and a Python
string-match would mark correct answers wrong constantly. This tool's job
ends at producing a well-formed Q&A set; core/prompt.txt tells the model how
to run the quiz turn-by-turn from there.
